# dbslice v3

Dbslice v3 is a new implementation of <a href="https://www.dbslice.org">dbslice</a> designed to support the three phases of data visualisation - explore, curate and embed - as <a href="https://www.dbslice.org/static/img/AIAA-2025-dbslice.pdf">described here</a>. 

New features include: 
- infinite canvas - giving the space to explore complex datasets;
- create, resize, zoom and pan on-the-fly;
- multiple datasets, each with multiple filters;
- increased support for extracting derived data (cut lines across multiple surfaces) and visualising it.

Dbslice v3 is under active development. Please visit <a href="https://www.dbslice.org">dbslice.org</a> and sign up to the mailing list to receive news direct to your inbox!
